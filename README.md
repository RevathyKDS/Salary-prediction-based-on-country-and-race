Salary Prediction Based on Country and Race

This project explores the relationship between country, race, and salary levels using Python. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify trends and disparities across different demographic groups.

The notebook also demonstrates a basic predictive modeling approach to estimate salary outcomes based on demographic features.

🔍 Project Overview

Goal: To analyze and predict salary levels with respect to country and race.

Approach:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

📈 Results & Insights

Clear differences in salary distribution exist across countries and races.

Predictive modeling shows that demographic variables can help estimate salary levels, but performance varies based on the model used.

Visual analysis highlights potential biases and inequalities in salary outcomes.
